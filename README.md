Designing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Machine Learning.

## Introduction

An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors a network or an endpoint for malicious activity or
policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation caught is stopped or reported. Machine
learning has the potential to makes this task much faster and more efficient.
